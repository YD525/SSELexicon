UISettings switches the interface language. If the language you need is not available, the "System.db" file in the root directory of the program is a database file in Sqlite format. Please open it with a database viewing tool.
Navicat or SQLiteExpert In short, any tool that can read the Sqlite database will do

Languages
The Languages ​​table is used to store some sensitive words to prevent them from being processed by the translation platform. There is no UI yet, so I will only explain its function.

Conjunction
The conjunction table is an advanced replacement logic used to analyze the context and replace words based on specific conditions. It is not yet implemented in the UI.

CloudTranslation
CloudTranslation is used to cache all records obtained from the translation platform

UILanguages
[UILanguages](
  [LangType] TEXT, 
  [Key] TEXT, 
  [Name] TEXT, 
  [Str] TEXT);

English is the default interface language.
The Str field is the content that needs to be modified
