# SSE Lexicon

**SSELex** is a fully open-source and free tool created to assist with Skyrim mod translation. It supports multiple file formats, including PEX, ESM, ESP, and MCM, offering enhanced convenience and flexibility for translators.  
By utilizing advanced string processing and optional online translation integration, SSELex helps streamline translation tasks and improve overall efficiency.  

I'm grateful to the following websites for kindly featuring **SSELex**.  
You can download it from any of them, or build the project yourself ‚Äî  
but knowing that you downloaded it makes me even happier!

## üîê About Open Source

Although **SSELex** is fully open-source, the code itself is carefully structured into well-defined layers.  
If I wished, I could easily open-source only selected parts ‚Äî I have both the technical means and the design to support such modular openness.

However, I chose to make the entire project open-source to ensure maximum transparency and trust.  
By doing so, I want users to feel completely confident that this tool is absolutely safe to use.

# ‚ù§Ô∏è Personal Note from the Developer

*As an open-source developer, the only real motivation I have to keep improving this project is seeing the download numbers on the release platforms.*

You may have noticed that I once planned to improve the logic related to PEX handling and validation ‚Äî but lately, I‚Äôve lost the motivation to continue.

To be honest, I sometimes feel **ashamed** when I see how low the download count is.  
What still supports me are a few kind and encouraging comments from users on the forums.  
That‚Äôs all I have left ‚Äî and I‚Äôm truly, deeply moved by their support.

> **9DM has at least 3,000 downloads, but on Nexus, it only shows 490 unique downloads.**  
> **It's already been updated from version 1.0 to 2.0, and a month has passed.**  
> **I can't hold on any longer.**

I don‚Äôt expect to gain anything from **SSELex** ‚Äî not donations, not fame.  
I created it because I wanted to contribute something truly useful to the modding community, especially for **international users**.

In fact, I prioritize solving problems reported by **non-Chinese users** first.  
I genuinely enjoy communicating across cultures, and I believe that if more users download and use this tool, it will open up more opportunities for **exchange, discussion, and collaboration**.  
That‚Äôs what keeps me going.

Maybe I‚Äôm a fool ‚Äî a big one ‚Äî for caring this much.  
But still, I hope this little project can become a **small bridge** between modders from all over the world.

If you‚Äôre using **SSELex**, even silently ‚Äî  
**thank you.**  
You‚Äôre already part of the reason I keep working on it.
