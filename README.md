# ❤️ Personal Note from the Developer

If you find this project helpful,  
consider giving it a ⭐ star —  
your support is the driving force behind ongoing development! ❤️

Also, if you're thinking about adapting **SSELex** to support other games, you're totally welcome to do so!  
The `TransItem` class is designed to be generic — you can construct your own instances and plug in custom readers for other game formats.  

Just fork the project and make your own modifications — it's easy to extend.  
And of course, if you contribute something awesome, your name will be added to the list of contributors. 😊

If you have any questions or need help, feel free to drop by our Discord — I'm always happy to help:

By the way, this entire tool is currently developed solely by me — **YD525**.  
While it’s built on top of excellent open-source frameworks like Mutagen and Champollion,  
the tool itself (logic, UI, workflow, translators, etc.) is written entirely by me.  
It’s a lot of work, and yes... I’m tired. 😩  
Your encouragement really means a lot!
