# SSE Lexicon - AI Translator

**SSE Lexicon** is a fully open-source and free tool created to assist with Skyrim mod translation. It supports multiple file formats, including PEX, ESM, ESP, and MCM, offering enhanced convenience and flexibility for translators.  
By utilizing advanced string processing and optional online translation integration, SSELex helps streamline translation tasks and improve overall efficiency.

If you want to give feedback, report issues, or discuss SSELex, please feel free to visit any of the following sites:  

- [Nexus Mods (for international users)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/143056)  

You can download it directly from Nexus Mods or build it yourself here. Both versions are kept up to date.

Your support and feedback are greatly appreciated!

## 🧩 Required Dependency

**SSE Lexicon** depends on the [**PhoenixEngine**](https://github.com/YD525/PhoenixEngine) library to function properly.  
This engine provides core logic and shared components used throughout SSELex.

> 🔧 **You must clone and compile `PhoenixEngine` separately before building SSELex.**

### Steps:

1. Clone the repository:  
   [https://github.com/YD525/PhoenixEngine](https://github.com/YD525/PhoenixEngine)

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio and build the project.

3. After building, make sure to **reference the generated DLLs** (e.g., `PhoenixEngine.dll`) in the **SSELex** project.  
   You can do this either by adding project references or linking the compiled DLLs directly.

This step is **mandatory** — the SSELex project will not build correctly without it.
