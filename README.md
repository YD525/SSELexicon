The "Start Translation" button allows users to translate all rows in bulk, while the ‌F1 shortcut‌ instantly translates the current line for quick single-row processing. This dual-function design streamlines multilingual workflows, enabling seamless switching between full-document translation and targeted line-by-line adjustments. The keyboard shortcuts enhance productivity by reducing mouse dependency, and the real-time translation engine supports high-precision conversions between multiple languages.
