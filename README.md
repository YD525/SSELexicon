# SSE Lexicon - AI Translator

**SSE Lexicon** is a fully open-source and free tool created to assist with Skyrim mod translation. It supports multiple file formats, including PEX, ESM, ESP, and MCM, offering enhanced convenience and flexibility for translators.  
By utilizing advanced string processing and optional online translation integration, SSE Lexicon helps streamline translation tasks and improve overall efficiency.

If you want to give feedback, report issues, or discuss SSE Lexicon, please feel free to visit any of the following sites:  

- [Nexus Mods (for international users)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/143056)  

You can download it directly from Nexus Mods or build it yourself here. Both versions are kept up to date.

Your support and feedback are greatly appreciated!

### Steps:

1. Clone the repository:  
   [https://github.com/YD525/PhoenixEngine](https://github.com/YD525/PhoenixEngine)

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio and build the project.

3. After building, make sure to **reference the generated DLLs** (e.g., `PhoenixEngine.dll`) in the **SSE Lexicon** project.  
   You can do this either by adding project references or linking the compiled DLLs directly.

This step is **mandatory** — the SSE Lexicon project will not build correctly without it.
