# ❤️ Personal Note from the Developer

SSELex and SSEAT may collaborate in the future, complementing each other’s strengths and addressing their respective weaknesses.

If you find this project helpful,  
consider giving it a ⭐ star —  
your support is the driving force behind ongoing development! ❤️

Also, if you're thinking about adapting **SSELex** to support other games, you're totally welcome to do so!  
The `TransItem` class is designed to be generic — you can construct your own instances and plug in custom readers for other game formats.  

Just fork the project and make your own modifications — it's easy to extend.  
And of course, if you contribute something awesome, your name will be added to the list of contributors. 😊

If you have any questions or need help, feel free to drop by our Discord — I'm always happy to help:  
[https://discord.gg/GRu7WtgqsB](https://discord.gg/GRu7WtgqsB)

By the way, this entire tool is currently developed solely by me — **YD525**.  
While it’s built on top of excellent open-source frameworks like Mutagen and Champollion,  
the tool itself (logic, UI, workflow, translators, etc.) is written entirely by me.  
It’s a lot of work, and yes... I’m tired. 😩  
Your encouragement really means a lot!
